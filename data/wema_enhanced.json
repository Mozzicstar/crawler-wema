      "For 80 years, Wema Bank has been a force for progress, empowering people, businesses, and communities.",
      "To the youth, we enable dreams. To the underprivileged, we bridge gaps. To the established, we drive success. To businesses, we fuel growth. To the finance industry, we set the pace. To the nation, we champion development. To the world, we promote innovation and sustainability. And to us, our customers are everything.",
      "For eight decades, we have led the way. And with you, the journey continues.",
      "In the heart of Nigeria’s active history, there’s a story that speaks of visionaries who dared to dream when the odds were stacked against them. This is the tale of Wema Bank, Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, whose journey spans over 80 years and is rooted in an audacious dream. From humble beginnings in a bungalow in Lagos, Nigeria in the 1940s to becoming Africa’s digital banking pioneer, Wema Bank’s legacy is built on one core principle - RESILIENCE.",
      "This article takes us through the story of how Wema Bank’s transformational journey began in 1945.",
      "THE FOUNDERS’ DREAM: THE DREAM THAT DEFIED THE IMPOSSIBLE",
      "In the 1940s, when Nigeria was under colonial rule, few could imagine a Nigerian-owned bank would exist. The idea seemed far-fetched, an impossible dream. But In a bungalow located in Ebute metta, Lagos, Nigeria began the story of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank and most resilient, Wema Bank, where an ambitious young man from the Okupe family of the Agbonmagbe Ruling House, the Late Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, had a vision—to establish an indigenous Bank that was built to last and fortified to serve the people for years to come.",
      "At the time, it seemed impractical and unattainable, but Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, a man who started his career earning a modest 20 shillings as salary, saw a future where Nigerians controlled their own financial destiny. He wasn’t alone in this vision. Alongside him were his wife, Mrs. Reginald Adekoya Okupe (R.A.O.), and Reverend Alabi, three dreamers who believed that an indigenous Nigerian bank was not just possible—it was necessary.",
      "Together, these three exceeded all expectations and did the impossible, establishing the only indigenous bank to have stood the test of time for eight decades, surviving pre-Independence Nigeria, the digital evolution and all eras which significantly restructured the banking industry, to standing strong in the 21st century as an industry leader and a pioneer of digital banking and innovation. This Bank is Wema Bank, Plc. and its birth name was Agbonmagbe Bank limited.",
      "THE ROAD TO AGBONMAGBE BANK LIMITED",
      "In 1939, Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe built Agbonmagbe Lodge, a building that still stands prominently today at the foot of the ramp leading into Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria from the third mainland bridge. In this timeless white bungalow (a place where dreams were turned into action), Chief Okupe birthed the vision of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, joining forces with his partner in love and partners in business, R.A.O. and Reverend Alabi, to bring the vision into reality.",
      "Out of context, one would wonder what was so special about that dream. After all, majority of the Nigerian Banking industry of today is populated with indigenous banks. A correct observation—one which unironically highlights the beauty of that dream.",
      "The intricacies of the colonial era are no news to any adult in today’s world. Before Nigeria gained independence in 1960, the country had lived under the British colonial rule for decades, using the British currencies, adopting the services they provided and existing under their governance. In such an era, the idea of an indigenous bank may have seemed unrealistic; “It won’t last”, “How will you do it?”, “Forget it”, “It is not even possible”; but it was. All that was needed was a group of determined and resourceful individuals ready to break through and do the impossible. Against skepticism, the founders pressed on, knowing that the foundation they were laying would become a cornerstone for future generations. And today, it is now known as Nigeria’s oldest, longest surviving, most resilient and innovative bank, Wema Bank,",
      "As the Agbonmagbe Bank Limited received its license to operate on May 2, 1945, a new chapter in Nigeria’s banking history began; marking the beginning of Wema Bank’s story.",
      "CHALLENGES AND RESILIENCE: A TEST OF STRENGTH",
      "As one of the thriving banks at the time, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited had earned the patronage of many Nigerians on individual, business and institutional levels. One of such stakeholders was the Western Nigeria Marketing Board, who had a fixed deposit of 200,000 pounds with the bank.",
      "However, No success story is without its trials, and for Wema Bank, the challenges came early. Despite flourishing in its early years, Agbonmagbe Bank faced its first major hurdle in 1968 when the government required banks to recapitalize to meet the minimum requirement over a certain period.",
      "Unfortunately, this development came at a crucial point in the journey of Agbonmagbe Bank Limited, resulting in the bank being unable to meet up with its plans for raising foreign investments within the stipulated period. In an unexpected twist of fate, The Western Nigeria Marketing Board converted their fixed deposit of 200,000 pounds into shares, making the Board the majority shareholder in the bank and allowing the bank to keep on—only, this time, with the Board owning the bank. This lifechanging turn of events left Chief Matthew Okupe and his partners with a tough decision to make: hand over the reins or risk seeing their dream disappear. They chose to let the legacy continue, even if it meant losing control. This pivotal moment ensured that the bank would survive and continue its mission.",
      "THE TOUGH DECISIONS ON THE ROAD TO SUCCESS: FROM AGBONMAGBE TO WEMA BANK PLC",
      "For years after its establishment, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited thrived, providing financial services from two small rooms in Agbonmagbe Lodge, fortified with secure windows that kept documents and funds safe in a 4-foot safe high that stands as a banking industry relic today, still at Agbonmagbe Lodge. Those two rooms in Agbonmagbe Lodge served as the first branch, subsequently expanding to branches in Ebute-metta, Sagamu, Abeokuta and Ijebu-Igbo.",
      "In 1969, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited evolved into Wema Bank Limited, a name that would eventually become synonymous with resilience and vision. As Nigeria moved into a new era, so too did the bank.",
      "As digital evolution took effect on the economy in the later parts of the 1900s, industries were gradually forced to restructure and adapt over the coming years, and institutions that were unable to act fast and implement the necessary adjustments had no choice but to go into extinction. Hundreds of financial institutions fizzled out, but Wema Bank remained resilient, surviving through the decades and continuing to deliver financial services as a private entity. Sadly, Chief Matthew Okupe passed on in 1984, leaving behind the profound legacy of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, a legacy which has continued to live on into its best decades.",
      "By 1987, Wema Bank Limited became Wema Bank plc, becoming a public limited liability company that became listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1990 under the symbol WEMABANK. By February 2001, the Bank was granted a Universal Banking License by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). By 2005, after the Soludo-led recapitalization exercise, Wema Bank merged with the then National Bank of Nigeria, acquiring National Bank and retaining the name, Wema Bank plc.",
      "Economic turbulence in the early 2000s led to dramatic restructuring. This time, the decision was to scale back and focus on regaining strength. By 2009, Wema Bank received its regional banking authorisation and took a step back to refuel, knowing that it had the resilience to come back stronger.",
      "BECOMING WEMA BANK PLC - A REBIRTH & THE RISE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION",
      "In the face of adversity, Wema Bank didn’t just survive—it reinvented itself. After years of restructuring, the bank rebranded itself as Nigeria’s most innovative bank, embracing technology as the future of banking. By 2015, Wema Bank regained its national banking license, ushering in a new chapter of growth and transformation.",
      "Slowly but surely, Wema Bank rebuilt itself over six years, restrategising with a new focus on innovation, customer centricity and transformation, thus rebranding from simply being Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank and most resilient bank to also becoming the Bank we all know today as Nigeria’s most innovative bank.",
      "Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank soon began to spearhead a digital transformation in the banking industry, going beyond the Wema Mobile App, which stood on par with other mobile banking apps in the industry, to pioneering ALAT, the first fully digital bank in Africa.",
      "This unexpected yet groundbreaking move shook the financial services industry, introducing a new era of banking where Nigerians could bank end-to-end without ever having to visit a physical branch. In its true nature of breaking new ground since birth, Wema Bank, within the past decade, has launched several industry firsts into the industry, leveraging its wealth of experience in the industry and its drive for innovation, futuristic and customer centric banking to discover new areas of need to provide solutions, meet needs and make remarkable impact.",
      "Over the past ten years, the Bank has introduced CoopHub, Nigeria’s first digital solution for cooperative societies; the ALAT Xplore App, Nigeria’s first licensed banking app for teenagers; ALATPay, an unparalleled payment gateway that streamlines the process of conducting transactions by eliminating the need for a middleman and providing instant settlement for business transactions on the gateway.",
      "Beyond pioneering innovation, Wema Bank has assumed the role of an enabler of innovation, empowering Nigerians to innovate on both individual and business levels. On the individual level, the Bank launched Hackaholics, its youth-focused hackathon that has empowered thousands of Nigerian youths to bring their innovative tech-driven ideas to life and become startup owners as early as their undergraduate years.",
      "The Bank has also launched partnerships with the Federal Government of Nigeria to introduce the FGN-ALAT Digital Skillnovation Programme for Youth and Business Owners, as well as the National Youth Service Corps to introduce the NYSC-ALAT Digital Skillnovation Programme, addressing unemployment and underemployment by equipping youth with digital and business skills, financial and material resources, practical insights on how to become highly sought after in their careers, and job placements to ensure a smooth education to employment transition for them.",
      "Currently, Wema Bank is a partner to over 80% of FINTECHs in the industry today, providing them with the infrastructure to operate and execute their operations.",
      "Having experienced the evolution of Nigeria’s economic trends and witnessed first-hand its impact on lives and businesses, Wema Bank did the groundwork of reinventing itself to become stronger and now, the Bank is on a quest to empower Nigerians on all levels to earn a sustainable living, become economically active, thrive and contribute to the economy of the country as a whole.",
      "Naturally, Wema Bank’s customer base and financial performance have continued to skyrocket since its reinvention and with a foolproof strategy of constantly adapting and innovating to deliver optimum value, meet needs and generate unparalleled impact, Wema Bank is evidently headed for the top of Africa’s financial industry—and it is beyond doubt at this point, that the Bank is well equipped to do so.",
      "WEMA BANK AT 80: THE BEST IS YET TO COME",
      "From its humble beginnings in a bungalow to over 160 branches in 26 states, to becoming a trailblazer in Africa’s banking sector, Wema Bank has proven that with determination, innovation, and a people-first approach, anything is possible. For 80 years, the Bank has stood resilient, evolving, and empowering Nigerians across all walks of life.",
      "The journey of Wema Bank stands deeply symbolic, representing the resilience of a Bank that rose in the depth of Nigeria’s colonial struggles as an indigenous and Nigerian-owned bank, surviving the worst to emerging one of the best.",
      "The celebration of Wema Bank’s 80th anniversary is one that calls for national honour. It is the celebration of the transformative Bank that proved that Nigerian-owned businesses have the capacity to last. For 8 decades, Wema Bank has stood the test of time, weathering all storms, navigating all hurdles and defying all odds to stand strong at 80 years, proving that the sky is indeed its starting point.",
      "Today, Wema Bank is not just a bank—it’s an institution. An institution in the financial industry that believes in the power of individuals, businesses, and communities to rise, innovate, and make a difference. As it looks to the future, Wema Bank’s story is far from over. In fact, the best is yet to come.",
      "Wema Bank has kicked off its 80th-anniversary celebration with the launch of its “80 Years of Spreading Love” Valentine campaign, running from February 1st to 28th, 2024. This campaign is the first in a series of exciting activities leading up to the bank’s grand 80th anniversary on May 2, 2025, and is designed to reward customer loyalty, strengthen connections, and create unforgettable experiences through 80 Acts of Love.",
      "With rewards tailored for every customer segment, Wema Bank is rolling out ?11,000,000 in cash prizes, gift cards, movie tickets, spa treatments, fitness access, and Uber vouchers for young professionals and students. Women and families will enjoy free SARA health consultations, business promotions, and networking opportunities, while Diaspora and Prestige customers can access discounted loans, cashback rewards, and priority banking services. SMEs and entrepreneurs aren’t left out, as they’ll benefit from free delivery services, business training sessions, Meta advert credits, and promotional support, alongside up to 15% off CIG Motors products and 5% off Green Asset products with free StarTimes decoders and a six-month subscription.",
      "The “80 Years of Spreading Love” campaign is just the beginning of a year-long celebration honoring the customers who have journeyed with Wema Bank over the past eight decades. To take part in the rewards, customers simply need to download ALAT and follow Wema Bank on social media for updates on exclusive benefits throughout the season of love.",

This pivotal moment ensured that the bank would survive and continue its mission.\n\nTHE TOUGH DECISIONS ON THE ROAD TO SUCCESS: FROM AGBONMAGBE TO WEMA BANK PLC\n\nFor years after its establishment, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited thrived, providing financial services from two small rooms in Agbonmagbe Lodge, fortified with secure windows that kept documents and funds safe in a 4-foot safe high that stands as a banking industry relic today, still at Agbonmagbe Lodge. Those two rooms in Agbonmagbe Lodge served as the first branch, subsequently expanding to branches in Ebute-metta, Sagamu, Abeokuta and Ijebu-Igbo.\n\nIn 1969, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited evolved into Wema Bank Limited, a name that would eventually become synonymous with resilience and vision. As Nigeria moved into a new era, so too did the bank.\n\nAs digital evolution took effect on the economy in the later parts of the 1900s, industries were gradually forced to restructure and adapt over the coming years, and institutions that were unable to act fast and implement the necessary adjustments had no choice but to go into extinction. Hundreds of financial institutions fizzled out, but Wema Bank remained resilient, surviving through the decades and continuing to deliver financial services as a private entity. Sadly, Chief Matthew Okupe passed on in 1984, leaving behind the profound legacy of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, a legacy which has continued to live on into its best decades.\n\nBy 1987, Wema Bank Limited became Wema Bank plc, becoming a public limited liability company that became listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1990 under the symbol WEMABANK. By February 2001, the Bank was granted a Universal Banking License by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). By 2005, after the Soludo-led recapitalization exercise, Wema Bank merged with the then National Bank of Nigeria, acquiring National Bank and retaining the name, Wema Bank plc.\n\nEconomic turbulence in the early 2000s led to dramatic restructuring. This time, the decision was to scale back and focus on regaining strength. By 2009, Wema Bank received its regional banking authorisation and took a step back to refuel, knowing that it had the resilience to come back stronger.\n\nBECOMING WEMA BANK PLC - A REBIRTH & THE RISE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION\n\nIn the face of adversity, Wema Bank didn’t just survive—it reinvented itself. After years of restructuring, the bank rebranded itself as Nigeria’s most innovative bank, embra",

      "Established on May 2, 1945, originally operating as a private limited liability company under the name Agbonmagbe Bank Limited, our institution traces its roots to the visionary Late Chief Mathew Adekoya Okupe. Commencing operations with branches in Ebute-metta, Sagamu, Abeokuta, and Ijebu-Igbo, the bank flourished under his leadership until it was acquired by the Western Nigeria Marketing Board. Subsequently, in 1969, it was rebranded as Wema Bank Limited.",
      "Wema Bank has etched its legacy as Nigeria's longest surviving indigenous bank, obtaining a commercial banking license and launching operations in the same year. The journey continued with the bank's conversion to a public limited liability company in 1987 and its listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1990 under the symbol WEMABANK. An important milestone was achieved in February 2001 when Wema Bank was granted a Universal Banking License, solidifying its position in the financial landscape. Today, we are proud to uphold a rich history of resilience, growth, and commitment to excellence.",
      "Since our listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1990 and the subsequent grant of a Universal Banking License by the Central Bank of Nigeria in February 2001, Wema Bank has consistently advanced its standing in the financial sector. In 2009, we attained the status of a regional bank, marking another milestone in our journey. Notably, our commitment to growth was evident in 2015 when we elevated our regional banking license to a national license, meeting the stringent regulatory requirements set by the Central Bank of Nigeria.",
      "This pivotal moment marked the initiation of a transformative decade for Wema Bank. In the first two years post-upgrade, we engaged in strategic re-evaluation and innovation, aiming to deliver more robust solutions that positively impact the lives of our customers and support their diverse goals. This period laid the foundation for a decade characterized by progressive initiatives and unwavering dedication to service excellence.",
      "The first and arguably the biggest of these innovative solutions created since becoming a national bank, was the launch of Africa’s first fully digital bank, ALAT, in 2017. Through the game-changing ALAT platform, we redefined banking through a wide array of reliable, seamless and intersectional banking services, all accessible on ALAT; making ALAT a one-stop app for every financial need.",
      "From conventional banking services like transfers and recharges to advanced features like shopping discounts, flight bookings, affordable insurance plans, cheap health consultations, and much more, ALAT has raised the standards of banking in Nigeria and created a truly rewarding banking experience for all. Over three million customers have been onboarded on the platform with over 500,000 previously unbanked persons onboarded in the past year.",

Another option available to you is by using the BVN\n              linking portal. In case you want to manage your BVN, the USSD code\n              to dial is *945*4#.\n\nLoan Rate Calculators –  Mortgage, Car Loan or Any Loan\n\nWema Bank.

      "In the heart of Nigeria’s active history, there’s a story that speaks of visionaries who dared to dream when the odds were stacked against them. This is the tale of Wema Bank, Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, whose journey spans over 80 years and is rooted in an audacious dream. From humble beginnings in a bungalow in Lagos, Nigeria in the 1940s to becoming Africa’s digital banking pioneer, Wema Bank’s legacy is built on one core principle - RESILIENCE. This article takes us through the story of how Wema Bank’s transformational journey began in 1945.THE FOUNDERS’ DREAM: THE DREAM THAT DEFIED THE IMPOSSIBLEIn the 1940s, when Nigeria was under colonial rule, few could imagine a Nigerian-owned bank would exist. The idea seemed far-fetched, an impossible dream. But In a bungalow located in Ebute metta, Lagos, Nigeria began the story of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank and most resilient, Wema Bank, where an ambitious young man from the Okupe family of the Agbonmagbe Ruling House, the Late Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, had a vision—to establish an indigenous Bank that was built to last and fortified to serve the people for years to come.At the time, it seemed impractical and unattainable, but Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, a man who started his career earning a modest 20 shillings as salary, saw a future where Nigerians controlled their own financial destiny. He wasn’t alone in this vision. Alongside him were his wife, Mrs. Reginald Adekoya Okupe (R.A.O.), and Reverend Alabi, three dreamers who believed that an indigenous Nigerian bank was not just possible—it was necessary. Together, these three exceeded all expectations and did the impossible, establishing the only indigenous bank to have stood the test of time for eight decades, surviving pre-Independence Nigeria, the digital evolution and all eras which significantly restructured the banking industry, to standing strong in the 21st century as an industry leader and a pioneer of digital banking and innovation. This Bank is Wema Bank, Plc. and its birth name was Agbonmagbe Bank limited. THE ROAD TO AGBONMAGBE BANK LIMITEDIn 1939, Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe built Agbonmagbe Lodge, a building that still stands prominently today at the foot of the ramp leading into Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria from the third mainland bridge. In this timeless white bungalow (a place where dreams were turned into action), Chief Okupe birthed the vision of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, joining forces with his partner in love and partners in business, R.A.O. and Reverend Alabi, to bring the vision into reality.Out of context, one would wonder what was so special about that dream. After all, majority of the Nigerian Banking industry of today is populated with indigenous banks. A correct observation—one which unironically highlights the beauty of that dream. The intricacies of the colonial era are no news to any adult in today’s world. Before Nigeria gained independence in 1960, the country had lived under the British colonial rule for decades, using the British currencies, adopting the services they provided and existing under their governance. In such an era, the idea of an indigenous bank may have seemed unrealistic; “It won’t last”, “How will you do it?”, “Forget it”, “It is not even possible”; but it was. All that was needed was a group of determined and resourceful individuals ready to break through and do the impossible. Against skepticism, the founders pressed on, knowing that the foundation they were laying would become a cornerstone for future generations. And today, it is now known as Nigeria’s oldest, longest surviving, most resilient and innovative bank, Wema Bank,As the Agbonmagbe Bank Limited received its license to operate on May 2, 1945, a new chapter in Nigeria’s banking history began; marking the beginning of Wema Bank’s story.CHALLENGES AND RESILIENCE: A TEST OF STRENGTHAs one of the thriving banks at the time, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited had earned the patronage of many Nigerians on individual, business and institutional levels. One of such stakeholders was the Western Nigeria Marketing Board, who had a fixed deposit of 200,000 pounds with the bank. However, No success story is without its trials, and for Wema Bank, the challenges came early. Despite flourishing in its early years, Agbonmagbe Bank faced its first major hurdle in 1968 when the government required banks to recapitalize to meet the minimum requirement over a certain period. Unfortunately, this development came at a crucial point in the journey of Agbonmagbe Bank Limited, resulting in the bank being unable to meet up with its plans for raising foreign investments within the stipulated period. In an unexpected twist of fate, The Western Nigeria Marketing Board converted their fixed deposit of 200,000 pounds into shares, making the Board the majority shareholder in the bank and allowing the bank to keep on—only, this time, with the Board owning the bank. This lifechanging turn of events left Chief Matthew Okupe and his partners with a tough decision to make: hand over the reins or risk seeing their dream disappear. They chose to let the legacy continue, even if it meant losing control. This pivotal moment ensured that the bank would survive and continue its mission.THE TOUGH DECISIONS ON THE ROAD TO SUCCESS: FROM AGBONMAGBE TO WEMA BANK PLCFor years after its establishment, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited thrived, providing financial services from two small rooms in Agbonmagbe Lodge, fortified with secure windows that kept documents and funds safe in a 4-foot safe high that stands as a banking industry relic today, still at Agbonmagbe Lodge. Those two rooms in Agbonmagbe Lodge served as the first branch, subsequently expanding to branches in Ebute-metta, Sagamu, Abeokuta and Ijebu-Igbo.In 1969, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited evolved into Wema Bank Limited, a name that would eventually become synonymous with resilience and vision. As Nigeria moved into a new era, so too did the bank. As digital evolution took effect on the economy in the later parts of the 1900s, industries were gradually forced to restructure and adapt over the coming years, and institutions that were unable to act fast and implement the necessary adjustments had no choice but to go into extinction. Hundreds of financial institutions fizzled out, but Wema Bank remained resilient, surviving through the decades and continuing to deliver financial services as a private entity. Sadly, Chief Matthew Okupe passed on in 1984, leaving behind the profound legacy of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, a legacy which has continued to live on into its best decades.By 1987, Wema Bank Limited became Wema Bank plc, becoming a public limited liability company that became listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1990 under the symbol WEMABANK. By February 2001, the Bank was granted a Universal Banking License by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). By 2005, after the Soludo-led recapitalization exercise, Wema Bank merged with the then National Bank of Nigeria, acquiring National Bank and retaining the name, Wema Bank plc.Economic turbulence in the early 2000s led to dramatic restructuring. This time, the decision was to scale back and focus on regaining strength. By 2009, Wema Bank received its regional banking authorisation and took a step back to refuel, knowing that it had the resilience to come back stronger. BECOMING WEMA BANK PLC - A REBIRTH & THE RISE OF DIGITAL INNOVATIONIn the face of adversity, Wema Bank didn’t just survive—it reinvented itself. After years of restructuring, the bank rebranded itself as Nigeria’s most innovative bank, embracing technology as the future of banking. By 2015, Wema Bank regained its national banking license, ushering in a new chapter of growth and transformation. Slowly but surely, Wema Bank rebuilt itself over six years, restrategising with a new focus on innovation, customer centricity and transformation, thus rebranding from simply being Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank and most resilient bank to also becoming the Bank we all know today as Nigeria’s most innovative bank. Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank soon began to spearhead a digital transformation in the banking industry, going beyond the Wema Mobile App, which stood on par with other mobile banking apps in the industry, to pioneering ALAT, the first fully digital bank in Africa. This unexpected yet groundbreaking move shook the financial services industry, introducing a new era of banking where Nigerians could bank end-to-end without ever having to visit a physical branch. In its true nature of breaking new ground since birth, Wema Bank, within the past decade, has launched several industry firsts into the industry, leveraging its wealth of experience in the industry and its drive for innovation, futuristic and customer centric banking to discover new areas of need to provide solutions, meet needs and make remarkable impact.Over the past ten years, the Bank has introduced CoopHub, Nigeria’s first digital solution for cooperative societies; the ALAT Xplore App, Nigeria’s first licensed banking app for teenagers; ALATPay, an unparalleled payment gateway that streamlines the process of conducting transactions by eliminating the need for a middleman and providing instant settlement for business transactions on the gateway.Beyond pioneering innovation, Wema Bank has assumed the role of an enabler of innovation, empowering Nigerians to innovate on both individual and business levels. On the individual level, the Bank launched Hackaholics, its youth-focused hackathon that has empowered thousands of Nigerian youths to bring their innovative tech-driven ideas to life and become startup owners as early as their undergraduate years. The Bank has also launched partnerships with the Federal Government of Nigeria to introduce the FGN-ALAT Digital Skillnovation Programme for Youth and Business Owners, as well as the National Youth Service Corps to introduce the NYSC-ALAT Digital Skillnovation Programme, addressing unemployment and underemployment by equipping youth with digital and business skills, financial and material resources, practical insights on how to become highly sought after in their careers, and job placements to ensure a smooth education to employment transition for them. Currently, Wema Bank is a partner to over 80% of FINTECHs in the industry today, providing them with the infrastructure to operate and execute their operations. Having experienced the evolution of Nigeria’s economic trends and witnessed first-hand its impact on lives and businesses, Wema Bank did the groundwork of reinventing itself to become stronger and now, the Bank is on a quest to empower Nigerians on all levels to earn a sustainable living, become economically active, thrive and contribute to the economy of the country as a whole.Naturally, Wema Bank’s customer base and financial performance have continued to skyrocket since its reinvention and with a foolproof strategy of constantly adapting and innovating to deliver optimum value, meet needs and generate unparalleled impact, Wema Bank is evidently headed for the top of Africa’s financial industry—and it is beyond doubt at this point, that the Bank is well equipped to do so. WEMA BANK AT 80: THE BEST IS YET TO COMEFrom its humble beginnings in a bungalow to over 160 branches in 26 states, to becoming a trailblazer in Africa’s banking sector, Wema Bank has proven that with determination, innovation, and a people-first approach, anything is possible. For 80 years, the Bank has stood resilient, evolving, and empowering Nigerians across all walks of life. The journey of Wema Bank stands deeply symbolic, representing the resilience of a Bank that rose in the depth of Nigeria’s colonial struggles as an indigenous and Nigerian-owned bank, surviving the worst to emerging one of the best. The celebration of Wema Bank’s 80th anniversary is one that calls for national honour. It is the celebration of the transformative Bank that proved that Nigerian-owned businesses have the capacity to last. For 8 decades, Wema Bank has stood the test of time, weathering all storms, navigating all hurdles and defying all odds to stand strong at 80 years, proving that the sky is indeed its starting point. Today, Wema Bank is not just a bank—it’s an institution. An institution in the financial industry that believes in the power of individuals, businesses, and communities to rise, innovate, and make a difference. As it looks to the future, Wema Bank’s story is far from over. In fact, the best is yet to come.",
      "In the heart of Nigeria’s active history, there’s a story that speaks of visionaries who dared to dream when the odds were stacked against them. This is the tale of Wema Bank, Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, whose journey spans over 80 years and is rooted in an audacious dream. From humble beginnings in a bungalow in Lagos, Nigeria in the 1940s to becoming Africa’s digital banking pioneer, Wema Bank’s legacy is built on one core principle - RESILIENCE.",
      "This article takes us through the story of how Wema Bank’s transformational journey began in 1945.",
      "THE FOUNDERS’ DREAM: THE DREAM THAT DEFIED THE IMPOSSIBLE",
      "In the 1940s, when Nigeria was under colonial rule, few could imagine a Nigerian-owned bank would exist. The idea seemed far-fetched, an impossible dream. But In a bungalow located in Ebute metta, Lagos, Nigeria began the story of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank and most resilient, Wema Bank, where an ambitious young man from the Okupe family of the Agbonmagbe Ruling House, the Late Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, had a vision—to establish an indigenous Bank that was built to last and fortified to serve the people for years to come.",
      "At the time, it seemed impractical and unattainable, but Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, a man who started his career earning a modest 20 shillings as salary, saw a future where Nigerians controlled their own financial destiny. He wasn’t alone in this vision. Alongside him were his wife, Mrs. Reginald Adekoya Okupe (R.A.O.), and Reverend Alabi, three dreamers who believed that an indigenous Nigerian bank was not just possible—it was necessary.",
      "Together, these three exceeded all expectations and did the impossible, establishing the only indigenous bank to have stood the test of time for eight decades, surviving pre-Independence Nigeria, the digital evolution and all eras which significantly restructured the banking industry, to standing strong in the 21st century as an industry leader and a pioneer of digital banking and innovation. This Bank is Wema Bank, Plc. and its birth name was Agbonmagbe Bank limited.",
      "THE ROAD TO AGBONMAGBE BANK LIMITED",
      "In 1939, Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe built Agbonmagbe Lodge, a building that still stands prominently today at the foot of the ramp leading into Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria from the third mainland bridge. In this timeless white bungalow (a place where dreams were turned into action), Chief Okupe birthed the vision of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, joining forces with his partner in love and partners in business, R.A.O. and Reverend Alabi, to bring the vision into reality.",
      "Out of context, one would wonder what was so special about that dream. After all, majority of the Nigerian Banking industry of today is populated with indigenous banks. A correct observation—one which unironically highlights the beauty of that dream.",

      "Wema Bank, Nigeria’s foremost innovative financial institution and pioneer of Africa’s first fully digital bank, ALAT, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past eight decades. Since its inception in 1945, Wema Bank has established itself as Nigeria's longest-surviving indigenous bank, consistently evolving to meet the needs of its customers while maintaining its relevance in the financial sector. From securing a commercial banking license in its founding year to its listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1990 and the acquisition of a Universal Banking License in 2001, Wema Bank’s trajectory has been marked by resilience, innovation, and strategic growth.The 1940s: Laying the FoundationWema Bank’s story began in 1945 when it was established as Agbonmagbe Bank Limited by Chief Mathew Adekoya Okupe, a prominent businessman and philanthropist. The Bank was founded with the primary objective of providing financial services to the people of Western Nigeria, particularly in the rural areas where access to banking was limited. At the time, Nigeria was still under British colonial rule, and the banking sector was dominated by foreign banks that catered primarily to the expatriate community and urban elites. Commencing operations with branches in Ebute-metta, Sagamu, Abeokuta, and Ijebu-Igbo, the Bank flourished under his leadership, focusing on serving the needs of local traders, farmers, and small businesses. The bank’s focus allowed it to build strong relationships with its customers and gain a deep understanding of the local economy.The 1960s: A New Era of Ownership and ExpansionLate 1960s, Nigeria had gained independence, and the country’s financial sector was undergoing significant changes. Recognizing the need for expansion and sustainability, the Western Nigeria Marketing Board acquired the Agbonmagba Bank in 1969 and renamed it Wema Bank Limited. This transition marked the beginning of a new era, bringing in fresh capital and a renewed focus on modernization and growth.The 1970s: National Ambitions and DiversificationThe 1970s were a time of optimism. During this decade, Wema Bank solidify its position in the Nigerian banking industry. Nigeria’s oil boom brought newfound wealth, and Wema Bank seized the opportunity and opened branches in Lagos, the bustling commercial hub, diversifying its product offerings, investing in new technologies, and gradually expanding into other regions. Here, Wema Bank was no longer just a Western Nigeria bank—it was becoming a national contender.One of the key milestones during this period was the Bank’s decision to expand beyond its regional base in Western Nigeria. In the 1970s, Wema Bank opened branches in other parts of the country, including Lagos, the commercial capital of Nigeria, and the northern and eastern regions. This expansion was driven by the bank’s ambition to become a national player and tap into the growing demand for banking services across the country.In addition to geographic expansion, Wema Bank also diversified its product portfolio to meet the changing needs of its customers. The Bank introduced new products and services, such as savings accounts, loans, and foreign exchange services, which helped it attract a broader customer base. The Bank also invested in new technologies, such as computerized banking systems, which improved its operational efficiency and customer service.The 1980s and 1990s: Transformation and ResilienceThe 1980s and 1990s represented a transformative period for Wema Bank as it began to look beyond its regional stronghold. Wema Bank embraced technological advancements, introduced more innovative banking products, and sought regulatory approvals to extend its services nationwide. In 1987, Wema Bank became a publicly quoted company on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), a significant step that provided the financial backing needed for its expansion efforts. The 1990s saw further growth, Wema Bank expanded its branch network beyond the Western Region into major cities such as Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. This decade was the transformative period for the Nigerian banking sector, presenting both challenges and opportunities. Amid economic shifts, regulatory changes, and industry-wide disruptions, Wema Bank demonstrated resilience and adaptability. While the bank encountered financial difficulties influenced by broader economic conditions, it seized the moment to refine its operations and strengthen its foundation.In the late 1990s, Wema Bank embarked on a comprehensive restructuring initiative aimed at enhancing financial stability, improving governance, and reinforcing customer trust. Through strategic recapitalization, the adoption of modern management practices, and the implementation of robust risk management controls, the Bank successfully repositioned itself for long-term growth. These proactive measures laid the groundwork for a stronger, more innovative institution ready to navigate the evolving financial landscape.The 2000s: Universal Banking and Strategic GrowthWema Bank’s commitment to growth and innovation was further reinforced in February 2001 when it received a Universal Banking License from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), officially recognizing it as a bank capable of operating across all regions of Nigeria. This was a culmination of years of strategic planning and execution aimed at scaling up operations and meeting national banking requirements. This license allowed the Wema Bank to offer a broader range of financial services, including investment banking and asset management, solidifying its presence in the financial landscape.The 2008-2009 global financial crisis and Nigeria’s banking sector reforms brought a period of transformation for the industry. Demonstrating strategic foresight, Wema Bank took a decisive step in 2009 by adopting a regional banking license. This approach allowed the bank to streamline its operations, enhance efficiency, and focus on strengthening its core markets. While this shift temporarily concentrated its presence in 12 states, it provided a solid foundation for future growth and innovation, setting the stage for the bank’s eventual return to national prominence.Having put in the work, Wema Bank embarked on an aggressive recapitalization effort. By 2015, the bank successfully raised the required funds to upgrade its license to a national authorization, once again allowing it to operate across Nigeria. This marked the beginning of a transformative decade for Wema Bank, characterized by innovation, strategic partnerships, and digital banking solutions. While some banks struggled to meet the new capital requirements, Wema Bank leveraged its strong financial base and strategic partnerships to thrive.In the first two years of post-upgrade, Wema Bank engaged in strategic re-evaluation and innovation, aiming to deliver more robust solutions that positively impact the lives of our customers and support their diverse goals. This period laid the foundation for a decade characterized by progressive initiatives and unwavering dedication to service excellence. The turn of the millennium marked the beginning of a new era for Wema Bank, as the bank embraced the digital revolution and embarked on a journey of transformation.The rapid advancement of technology and the increasing adoption of digital banking services presented both opportunities and challenges for the bank. Recognizing these advancements in the banking sector and the shift in customer preferences towards digital banking, Wema Bank in 2027 launched ALAT, Africa’s first fully digital bank. ALAT revolutionized banking by offering seamless account opening, savings plans, virtual cards, and automated services, setting the bank apart as a digital banking pioneer. The launch of ALAT was a bold move that positioned Wema Bank as a forward-thinking institution, catering to a new generation of tech-savvy customers.ALAT’s introduction allowed customers to open accounts, transfer money, pay bills, access loans, and conduct transactions entirely online through their mobile devices, making banking more accessible and convenient. The platform quickly gained traction among young professionals and entrepreneurs, reinforcing Wema Bank’s reputation as an innovative and customer-centric institution.This period also saw Wema Bank expanding its service offerings to include financial technology (fintech) collaborations, SME banking solutions, and enhanced retail banking services. These initiatives were aimed at expanding the bank’s reach and making its services more accessible to customers, particularly in underserved areas. The bank also leveraged data analytics to enhance its customer insights and improve its decision-making processes.By the early 2020s, Wema Bank had established itself as a leading player in the Nigerian banking sector, with a strong presence in both the traditional and digital banking spaces. This innovation demonstrated Wema Bank's commitment to leading in the digital banking space while expanding its geographical footprint.One of the key approaches Wema Bank adopted in its quest to become a national bank was expanding its branch network and establishing a presence in key markets across the country. The bank opened new branches in strategic locations, particularly in the northern and eastern regions, where it had previously been underrepresented. This expansion was driven by the bank’s ambition to serve a broader customer base and tap into the growing demand for banking services in these regions.In addition to geographic expansion, Wema Bank also focused on strengthening its product offerings and customer service. The Bank introduced new products and services, such as SME loans, mortgage financing, and wealth management services, which were designed to meet the diverse needs of its customers. Looking Ahead: A Legacy of Resilience and Innovation with PossibilitiesWema Bank’s journey to a nationally recognized financial institution demonstrates the importance of adapting to changing market conditions while staying true to core values. As Bank continues to evolve, its experience shows that successful banking transformation requires a careful balance of traditional strengths with modern innovations.A review of the Bank’s journey reflects the achievements of significant milestones.

These proactive measures laid the groundwork for a stronger, more innovative institution ready to navigate the evolving financial landscape.",
      "The 2000s: Universal Banking and Strategic Growth",
      "Wema Bank’s commitment to growth and innovation was further reinforced in February 2001 when it received a Universal Banking License from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), officially recognizing it as a bank capable of operating across all regions of Nigeria.

Over the past eight decades, Wema Bank has remained committed to its mission of providing exceptional financial services to its customers and contributing to the development of the Nigerian economy.",
      "Nigeria’s banking landscape has transformed significantly over the past century. From an era dominated by foreign financial institutions to one where indigenous bank, Wema Bank now set the pace. The journey has been one of resilience, innovation, and adaptation. At the heart of this transformation stands Wema Bank, Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, which has not only witnessed but actively shaped the country’s financial evolution for the past 80 years.Founded in 1945 as Agbonmagbe Bank, Wema Bank has grown from a modest financial institution into a key player in the Nigerian banking sector. This journey, spanning eight decades, mirrors Nigeria’s broader economic history—marked by colonial influences, post-independence aspirations, regulatory shifts, and digital transformation. As Wema Bank celebrates its 80th anniversary come May 2nd, 2025, it provides an opportunity to reflect on how far banking has come in Nigeria and the crucial role the institution has played in shaping the financial ecosystem.The early days of banking in Nigeria were defined by the dominance of British-controlled financial institutions such as the Bank of British West Africa (BBWA, now First Bank) and Barclays Bank (now Union Bank). The absence of credit facilities for local businesses created a major gap in the financial system and economic growth among Nigerians.Against this, the emergence of indigenous banks became a necessity rather than a choice. The establishment of Agbonmagbe Bank in 1945 by Chief Mathew Adekoya Agbonmagbe Okupe was a bold response to this financial exclusion. The bank sought to provide accessible financial services to Nigerian traders, farmers, and small business owners who had long been marginalized by the colonians.At the time, many Nigerians relied on informal savings and credit systems such as Esusu and cooperative societies. While these systems played a critical role in sustaining local economies, they lacked the structure, security, and scale required to drive large-scale economic development. Agbonmagbe Bank, and other indigenous banks that followed, filled this gap by offering formal banking services tailored to the needs of Nigerians.Nigeria’s independence in 1960 marked a turning point in the banking sector. The new government recognized the importance of financial institutions in nation-building and actively promoted the establishment and expansion of indigenous banks. This period saw a surge in banking activities, with new policies aimed at ensuring that local businesses and individuals had access to financial services.Wema Bank, then Agbonmagbe Bank, played a critical role in this new financial landscape. The Western Regional Government under Chief Obafemi Awolowo strongly supported the bank, ensuring that government institutions and businesses patronized its services. This strategic partnership allowed the bank to grow rapidly, expanding its branch network and deepening its reach within the southwestern region of Nigeria.In 1969, the bank rebranded as Wema Bank, a move that signified its ambition to operate on a broader scale. This change was part of a larger transformation within Nigeria’s banking sector, as indigenous banks sought to modernize their operations and compete with their foreign counterparts.The 1970s and 1980s were periods of significant economic change in Nigeria. The oil boom of the 1970s brought unprecedented revenue, but the subsequent economic downturn in the 1980s exposed structural weaknesses in the financial system. Many banks struggled with liquidity issues, poor management, and regulatory non-compliance, leading to the collapse of several indigenous financial institutions.Wema Bank, however, demonstrated remarkable resilience during this period. By adopting prudent financial management practices and aligning with regulatory requirements, the bank managed to stay afloat while many of its peers faltered.The introduction of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in 1986 by the military government further reshaped the banking sector. SAP led to the liberalization of the financial industry, encouraging the establishment of more banks and increasing competition. This period saw the proliferation of new-generation banks that introduced modern banking practices, forcing older institutions to innovate or risk becoming obsolete.Wema Bank adapted to these changes by expanding its services, improving customer experience, and leveraging technology to enhance its operations. The bank’s ability to evolve with the times cemented its status as a key player in Nigeria’s banking industry.The early 2000s ushered in yet another wave of transformation in Nigeria’s banking industry. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), under Governor Charles Soludo, introduced a major banking consolidation exercise in 2005, raising the minimum capital requirement for banks from ?2 billion to ?25 billion. This policy led to a series of mergers, acquisitions, and the outright collapse of weaker banks.Wema Bank, in its determination to survive, made a strategic decision to transform into a regional bank, allowing it to operate within a defined geographical area while maintaining financial stability. This move allowed the bank to restructure its operations and focus on delivering quality financial services.However, Wema Bank’s most groundbreaking transformation came in 2017 with the launch of ALAT, Nigeria’s first fully digital bank. At a time when fintech startups were disrupting traditional banking models, Wema Bank took the bold step of embracing digital innovation. ALAT revolutionized banking in Nigeria by offering a seamless, branchless banking experience that catered to tech-savvy customers.This innovation positioned Wema Bank as a leader in digital banking, demonstrating its ability to not just adapt to change but also set new industry standards.

      "How It All BeganWema Bank, founded by the late Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, is an indigenous financial institution created by dint of hard work, modesty, resilience and innovation, was formerly known as Agbonmagbe Bank. Prior to its establishment, the financial institution which is now known as Wema Bank, had gained huge patronage of many people and entities. One of these entities was the Western Marketing Board. At one point, the Western Marketing Board (WMB) had deposited close to 200,000 pounds in a fixed deposit account in Agbonmagbe Bank.It happened that at that time, the money was converted into shares and coincidentally, the government raised the capital base of banks at that period. But unfortunately, the time was too short for the bank to raise that money to meet the condition set by the government, the Western Marketing Board decided to convert the money it saved in a fixed account in Agbonmagbe Bank to shares and on converting the money, automatically become the majority shareholder and thereafter took over the bank.According to Alaba Adegboyega Okupe, the eldest surviving son of the late founder of  Wema Bank, Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, who witnessed the bank’s transformation stated that the bank thereafter changed its name from Agbonmagbe Bank to Wema Bank and that the bank was duly incorporated on May 2, 1945. Alaba added that the bank commenced operations as a legally licensed bank two days later. He also said that the bank which is today known as Wema Bank started from a very humble and modest beginning has made a name for itself not just as Nigeria’s oldest indigenous and most resilient bank but also a beacon of hope and empowerment for Nigerians. He submitted that Wema Bank has transformed from championing innovative solutions that bridge gaps to delivering of practical and impactful services to banking the unbanked across the length and breadth of Nigeria, thereby setting the pace for other the banking industry to thrive and empower the next generation.Comments By the surviving Eldest Son of the Founder of Wema BankAccording to him, “I believe that Wema Bank is equipped to carry for another century, perhaps even more. I see the work Wema Bank is doing and it is highly commendable to say the least. The bank had previously reached about a decade ago during its 70th anniversary celebration in 2015, extending an invitation to us to attend the event and Wema bank made a courteous gesture by giving us 2,000,000 of ordinary shares of 50 kobo each which is commendable.’“More recently, I got a visit from some of the staff and executive of Wema Bank and we had some very insightful discussions and they also extended a verbal invitation to us to the 80th anniversary celebration ahead of the physical invitation. I look forward to celebrating this great milestone with Wema Bank “Honestly, I am happy and grateful to be alive in my 80s to see the vision that my father foresaw in 1945 also become 80 years strong. What my father’s trailblazing act of service to his indigenous people has not only grown to become the longest standing indigenous bank in Nigeria but also a trailblazer in innovative banking and financial services. It is a beautiful thing to see such resilience, growth and impactful transformation “It is a pleasure to see that Wema Bank is flourishing and growing from strength to strength. It is God who implanted the idea in 1945 and it was from a humble beginning. I wish Wema Bank a happy 80th anniversary. More grease to your elbows, future developments and limitless growth. The sky is your stepping stone.” He concluded.Beyond the above, the bank has achieved some milestones, which includes : the renaming of the of the bank from Agbonmagbe bank to Wema Bank in 1969, securing regional banking in 2009, transition to a national bank in 2015 and pioneered Africa’s first fully digital bank with the introduction of ALAT F Former Chairman, Board of Director’s, Adeyinka Asekun Testament Also speaking on the Wema Bank At 80: A Testament To Growth, Innovation And Legacy, the former Chairman of the Board of Directors, Wema Bank (December 2012 to May 2017), Adeyinka Asekun, stated that he was at Wema Bank during at a time he described as not only a consequential period but also a period that was very pivotal to the making or the breaking of the bank. He added that it was a time of great challenge in Wema Bank and that he believed God helped the institution to overcome the challenge.“I always like to recall that during that period, there were several key things that took place that were important and I give the credit to the management and the board. The management was very professional, very focused, very disciplined, and capable of thinking strategically. The board on its part was very cohesive, very united, and very trusting. The board trusted members trusted one another, which I thought was important. So several key things took place. The first thing I would like to mention is that the bank was able to recapitalise. We had a problem with capital, which was resolved. We were able to get a strategic investor. We were able to recapitalise the bank. That was one. “The second thing is that during that period we returned to profitability. The bank had been making losses but during that period we were able to start making a profit again. During that period the bank was able to upgrade from a regional banking license to a national banking license which also was a very, very significant thing.“During that period also, exactly to be precise, when the bank turned 70 in 2015, we were able to rebrand the bank and breathe fresh life into the brand. So from previously looking like a grandfather bank, we became a more vibrant, dynamic bank,” he said Major MilestonesAdeyinka posited that the final thing which happened before he stepped down as Chairman in 2017 was that on May 2, 2017, when the bank turned 72 years old, it launched Nigeria’s first fully digital bank; ALAT, which according to him was in a sense the crowning glory of that period. He pointed out that it was a very pivotal time during the affairs of the bank, and it changed the trajectory of the bank altogether.“I look back at that period with fondness. I went on to become Nigeria’s High Commissioner to Canada, which I did for another six years. But I look back at this period with great fondness. I am really thrilled with the management; I describe the management in very glowing terms, and it is for a reason. I think the results speak for themselves. “Beyond the profitability, you are looking at viability. You are looking at a bank which has redefined itself. The bank has been transformed.” he said.  Speaking further on the bank’s innovation ALAT, Adeyinka said, “ALAT has won all manner of awards, over 30 awards, for being surely innovative, and successful, and impactful. And Wema Bank ‘s transformation is being studied as a case study in Lagos Business School and the George Business School, University of Cambridge.”Still speaking on innovation, the former Chairman said that Wema Bank was able to survive, make profit and return to viability despite the challenges.“We were once again a viable growing concern. But you need to move beyond just surviving. How do you now thrive? And we were in an industry that had a lot of very heavy hitters. There were some banks with massive balance sheets that were obviously able to do all kinds of big transactions and big business. So we needed to define a niche for ourselves where we could be viable and thrive and technology was a means to an end because by that time one of the challenges the bank faced was that it needed to capture a younger target market. And what did those people require? “They required convenience. They required solutions that were nimble and worked for them. Technology was a means to an end. Technology was our means of being able to reach out to these people and meet their needs because you are looking at a generation that is very tech-savvy. We know that the youths who are at the bulk of our population are very much into technology. But the idea was to get the right technology so it is not just about deploying technology but deploying it properly. And a digital bank made a lot of sense. “There was a lot of research that was done by the bank. It was not just a question of pie in the sky. There was research that was conducted that made it quite clear that the digital bank was something that the market was waiting for. And ALAT was birthed.” Adeyinka said.The future of Wema Bank he insisted, is very, very bright, as the bank has displayed an ability to reinvent itself and an ability to innovate, adding that its ability to innovate is very, very important and that the bank has shown itself able to do that.According to him, “If you look at what the bank has done, you look at ALAT for Business, you look at SARA, ALAT Xplore, Coop Hub, Hackaholics etc. you see an ongoing effort to keep on doing new things, to take on new segments, and meet new needs. And as far as you keep the customer as your focus and the center of what you are doing, the sky is the limit. The bank has also shown itself to be able to respond quickly to situations and circumstances. So, I am very, very optimistic about the future for the bank.” Wema Bank’s Legacy On Wema Bank’s legacy, the ex-Chairman of the Board of Directors posited that several banks have gone under between the year 1988 till the 2017, when he stepped down as the Chairman of Wema Bank, adding that Wema Bank over the years has not only deployed technology to make its operation seamless but that beyond that it has also embraced innovation which, he said has won several awards because of its acceptance.He commended the bank for weathering the regulatory storm and for demonstrating resilience and adaptability to operate for 80 years, adding that the feat is an uncommon one and deserves commendation for the enviable legacy “In looking at an industry, if you look at the number of banks, I worked in the banking industry effectively from November 1988 till I stepped down as chairman of Wema from 2017. The number of banks that I have seen that have failed in Nigeria, and I can think of at least 79 banks that have failed. So, for a bank to be around for 80 years is a legacy. It is something to look back at with a lot of pride and to hope that the future will certainly be bright, and I believe it will be.Congratulating Wema Bank on its 80th anniversary celebration, Adeyinka said, “I say 80 looks good. I say the best is yet to come. I say that we have achieved a lot of things in the past, but the future is much brighter. Keep on innovating. Keep on keeping the customer at the focus and keep on winning. God bless”",

This is the tale of Wema Bank, Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, whose journey spans over 80 years and is rooted in an audacious dream. From humble beginnings in a bungalow in Lagos, Nigeria in the 1940s to becoming Africa’s digital banking pioneer, Wema Bank’s legacy is built on one core principle - RESILIENCE. This article takes us through the story of how Wema Bank’s transformational journey began in 1945.THE FOUNDERS’ DREAM: THE DREAM THAT DEFIED THE IMPOSSIBLEIn the 1940s, when Nigeria was under colonial rule, few could imagine a Nigerian-owned bank would exist. The idea seemed far-fetched, an impossible dream. But In a bungalow located in Ebute metta, Lagos, Nigeria began the story of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank and most resilient, Wema Bank, where an ambitious young man from the Okupe family of the Agbonmagbe Ruling House, the Late Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, had a vision—to establish an indigenous Bank that was built to last and fortified to serve the people for years to come.At the time, it seemed impractical and unattainable, but Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, a man who started his career earning a modest 20 shillings as salary, saw a future where Nigerians controlled their own financial destiny. He wasn’t alone in this vision. Alongside him were his wife, Mrs. Reginald Adekoya Okupe (R.A.O.), and Reverend Alabi, three dreamers who believed that an indigenous Nigerian bank was not just possible—it was necessary. Together, these three exceeded all expectations and did the impossible, establishing the only indigenous bank to have stood the test of time for eight decades, surviving pre-Independence Nigeria, the digital evolution and all eras which significantly restructured the banking industry, to standing strong in the 21st century as an industry leader and a pioneer of digital banking and innovation. This Bank is Wema Bank, Plc. and its birth name was Agbonmagbe Bank limited. THE ROAD TO AGBONMAGBE BANK LIMITEDIn 1939, Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe built Agbonmagbe Lodge, a building that still stands prominently today at the foot of the ramp leading into Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria from the third mainland bridge. In this timeless white bungalow (a place where dreams were turned into action), Chief Okupe birthed the vision of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, joining forces with his partner in love and partners in business, R.A.O. and Reverend Alabi, to bring the vision into reality.Out of context, one would wonder what was so special about that dream. After all, majority of the Nigerian Banking industry of today is populated with indigenous banks. A correct observation—one which unironically highlights the beauty of that dream. The intricacies of the colonial era are no news to any adult in today’s world. Before Nigeria gained independence in 1960, the country had lived under the British colonial rule for decades, using the British currencies, adopting the services they provided and existing under their governance. In such an era, the idea of an indigenous bank may have seemed unrealistic; “It won’t last”, “How will you do it?”, “Forget it”, “It is not even possible”; but it was. All that was needed was a group of determined and resourceful individuals ready to break through and do the impossible. Against skepticism, the founders pressed on, knowing that the foundation they were laying would become a cornerstone for future generations. And today, it is now known as Nigeria’s oldest, longest surviving, most resilient and innovative bank, Wema Bank,As the Agbonmagbe Bank Limited received its license to operate on May 2, 1945, a new chapter in Nigeria’s banking history began; marking the beginning of Wema Bank’s story.CHALLENGES AND RESILIENCE: A TEST OF STRENGTHAs one of the thriving banks at the time, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited had earned the patronage of many Nigerians on individual, business and institutional levels. One of such stakeholders was the Western Nigeria Marketing Board, who had a fixed deposit of 200,000 pounds with the bank. However, No success story is without its trials, and for Wema Bank, the challenges came early. Despite flourishing in its early years, Agbonmagbe Bank faced its first major hurdle in 1968 when the government required banks to recapitalize to meet the minimum requirement over a certain period. Unfortunately, this development came at a crucial point in the journey of Agbonmagbe Bank Limited, resulting in the bank being unable to meet up with its plans for raising foreign investments within the stipulated period. In an unexpected twist of fate, The Western Nigeria Marketing Board converted their fixed deposit of 200,000 pounds into shares, making the Board the majority shareholder in the bank and allowing the bank to keep on—only, this time, with the Board owning the bank. This lifechanging turn of events left Chief Matthew Okupe and his partners with a tough decision to make: hand over the reins or risk seeing their dream disappear. They chose to let the legacy continue, even if it meant losing control. This pivotal moment ensured that the bank would survive and continue its mission.THE TOUGH DECISIONS ON THE ROAD TO SUCCESS: FROM AGBONMAGBE TO WEMA BANK PLCFor years after its establishment, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited thrived, providing financial services from two small rooms in Agbonmagbe Lodge, fortified with secure windows that kept documents and funds safe in a 4-foot safe high that stands as a banking industry relic today, still at Agbonmagbe Lodge. Those two rooms in Agbonmagbe Lodge served as the first branch, subsequently expanding to branches in Ebute-metta, Sagamu, Abeokuta and Ijebu-Igbo.In 1969, Agbonmagbe Bank Limited evolved into Wema Bank Limited, a name that would eventually become synonymous with resilience and vision. As Nigeria moved into a new era, so too did the bank. As digital evolution took effect on the economy in the later parts of the 1900s, industries were gradually forced to restructure and adapt over the coming years, and institutions that were unable to act fast and implement the necessary adjustments had no choice but to go into extinction. Hundreds of financial institutions fizzled out, but Wema Bank remained resilient, surviving through the decades and continuing to deliver financial services as a private entity. Sadly, Chief Matthew Okupe passed on in 1984, leaving behind the profound legacy of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank, a legacy which has continued to live on into its best decades.By 1987, Wema Bank Limited became Wema Bank plc, becoming a public limited liability company that became listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1990 under the symbol WEMABANK. By February 2001, the Bank was granted a Universal Banking License by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). By 2005, after the Soludo-led recapitalization exercise, Wema Bank merged with the then National Bank of Nigeria, acquiring National Bank and retaining the name, Wema Bank plc.Economic turbulence in the early 2000s led to dramatic restructuring. This time, the decision was to scale back and focus on regaining strength. By 2009, Wema Bank received its regional banking authorisation and took a step back to refuel, knowing that it had the resilience to come back stronger. BECOMING WEMA BANK PLC - A REBIRTH & THE RISE OF DIGITAL INNOVATIONIn the face of adversity, Wema Bank didn’t just survive—it reinvented itself. After years of restructuring, the bank rebranded itself as Nigeria’s most innovative bank, embracing technology as the future of banking. By 2015, Wema Bank regained its national banking license, ushering in a new chapter of growth and transformation. Slowly but surely, Wema Bank rebuilt itself over six years, restrategising with a new focus on innovation, customer centricity and transformation, thus rebranding from simply being Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank and most resilient bank to also becoming the Bank we all know today as Nigeria’s most innovative bank. Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank soon began to spearhead a digital transformation in the banking industry, going beyond the Wema Mobile App, which stood on par with other mobile banking apps in the industry, to pioneering ALAT, the first fully digital bank in Africa. This unexpected yet groundbreaking move shook the financial services industry, introducing a new era of banking where Nigerians could bank end-to-end without ever having to visit a physical branch. In its true nature of breaking new ground since birth, Wema Bank, within the past decade, has launched several industry firsts into the industry, leveraging its wealth of experience in the industry and its drive for innovation, futuristic and customer centric banking to discover new areas of need to provide solutions, meet needs and make remarkab",
