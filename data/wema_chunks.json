This article takes us through the story of how Wema Bank’s transformational journey began in 1945.  THE FOUNDERS’ DREAM: THE DREAM THAT DEFIED THE IMPOSSIBLE  In the 1940s, when Nigeria was under colonial rule, few could imagine a Nigerian-owned bank would exist. The idea seemed far-fetched, an impossible dream. But In a bungalow located in Ebute metta, Lagos, Nigeria began the story of Nigeria’s oldest indigenous bank and most resilient, Wema Bank, where an ambitious young man from the Okupe family of the Agbonmagbe Ruling House, the Late Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, had a vision—to establish an indigenous Bank that was"

At the time, it seemed impractical and unattainable, but Chief Matthew Adekoya Okupe, a man who started his career earning a modest 20 shillings as salary, saw a future where Nigerians controlled their own financial destiny. He wasn’t alone in this vision. Alongside him were his wife, Mrs. Reginald Adekoya Okupe (R.A.O.), and Reverend Alabi, three dreamers who believed that an indigenous Nigerian bank was not just possible—it was necessary.  Together, these three exceeded all expectations and did the impossible, establishing the only indigenous bank to have stood the test of time for eight decades, surviving pre-Independence Nigeria, the digital evolution and all eras which significantly restructured the banking industry,"

The intricacies of the colonial era are no news to any adult in today’s world. Before Nigeria gained independence in 1960, the country had lived under the British colonial rule for decades, using the British currencies, adopting the services they provided and existing under their governance. In such an era, the idea of an indigenous bank may have seemed unrealistic; “It won’t last”, “How will you do it?”, “Forget it”, “It is not even possible”; but it was. All that was needed was a group of determined and resourceful individuals ready to break through and do the impossible. Against skepticism, the founders pressed on, knowing that the"

Unfortunately, this development came at a crucial point in the journey of Agbonmagbe Bank Limited, resulting in the bank being unable to meet up with its plans for raising foreign investments within the stipulated period. In an unexpected twist of fate, The Western Nigeria Marketing Board converted their fixed deposit of 200,000 pounds into shares, making the Board the majority shareholder in the bank and allowing the bank to keep on—only, this time, with the Board owning the bank.

As digital evolution took effect on the economy in the later parts of the 1900s, industries were gradually forced to restructure and adapt over the coming years, and institutions that were unable to act fast and implement the necessary adjustments had no choice but to go into extinction. Hundreds of financial institutions fizzled out, but Wema Bank remained resilient, surviving through the decades and continuing to deliver financial services as a private entity.
